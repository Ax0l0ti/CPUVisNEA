# Welcoke to CPU Visualised
This is a bespoke windows form application I created for Brentwood School to aid Education covering the following topics: 
> Assembly language
> 
> CPU Special Purpose Registers
> 
> OOP design

This project doubled as my Non Examined Assessment during A-Levels.

Note : this project is no longer maintained.
